Gitlet Design Document
----------------------


Classes and Data Structures
---------------------------
Main class

Commit class

Blob class



Algorithms
----------
No algorithms, just using hashmaps.

Persistence
-----------
In order to keep track of the changes made to files,
I will serialize commits and blobs every time I call a gitlet Main.main
function. I will then store it in a folder called "storage", and then, when I call
any function, I will deserialize all commits pertinent to the function and blobs being
modified.
